PyLucene is a JCC-compiled Python extension of Java Lucene and wouldn't be
possible without the tireless efforts of the people and open source projects
below.

  - the Apache Lucene developers,
    http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/whoweare.html

  - the Open Source Applications Foundation, for hosting the project from
    2004 to 2008: http://www.osafoundation.org

  - Andi Vajda, PyLucene and JCC project founder and maintainer, for
    believing that PyLucene should be feasible

  - the following people contributed patches, samples, bug reports 
    and resources: 
     . Kapil Thangavelu (hazmat): FSDirectory support, first unit test
     . Frank Wierzbicki: IndexFiles.py and SearchFiles.py samples
     . Andreas Jung: several bug reports, nasty bugs indeed
     . Jeff Bowden: several bug reports and API additions via patches
     . Wai Yip Tung: test_PyLuceneThread.py unit test, windows threads testing
     . Yura Smolsky: test_Highlighter.py unit test, numerous bug reports
     . Steve Jenson: MultiFieldQueryParser addition to test_PyLucene.py
     . Erik Hatcher: man page index and search samples
     . Bill Janssen: many bug reports and 'shared mode' suggestion
     . Aaron Lav: several memory leaks, fixed with patches and tests
     . Grant Ingersoll: for inviting and sponsoring PyLucene's move to Apache

Thank you all !
