#
#  Port of java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/icu/ICUFoldingFilter.java
#  using IBM's C++ ICU wrapped by PyICU (https://github.com/ovalhub/pyicu)
#
#  A TokenFilter that applies search term folding to Unicode text,
#  applying foldings from UTR#30 Character Foldings.
#
#  This filter applies the following foldings from the report to unicode text:
#
#  Accent removal
#  Case folding
#  Canonical duplicates folding
#  Dashes folding
#  Diacritic removal (including stroke, hook, descender)
#  Greek letterforms folding
#  Han Radical folding
#  Hebrew Alternates folding
#  Jamo folding
#  Letterforms folding
#  Math symbol folding
#  Multigraph Expansions: All
#  Native digit folding
#  No-break folding
#  Overline folding
#  Positional forms folding
#  Small forms folding
#  Space folding
#  Spacing Accents folding
#  Subscript folding
#  Superscript folding
#  Suzhou Numeral folding
#  Symbol folding
#  Underline folding
#  Vertical forms folding
#  Width folding
#
#  Additionally, Default Ignorables are removed, and text is normalized to NFKC.
#  All foldings, case folding, and normalization mappings are applied
#  recursively to ensure a fully folded and normalized result.
